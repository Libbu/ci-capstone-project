### HTML5 Validation

[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate HTML code for all templates used in the project.

HTML code stripped of Django template tags was accessed by viewing the page source of each template. Code was validated by direct input. Where errors in HTML were detected these were remedied. Any code which had to be fixed was validated again by direct input to check the error had been resolved, and then by URI

Unremedied errors consisted of the behaviour of Django template elements which I was unable to change.
