# Calm Cadence (Capstone Project for CI/Coleg Gwent Bootcamp)

![Calm Cadence](https://github.com/Libbu/ci-capstone-project/blob/main/media/amiresponsive.JPG)

Calm Cadence is a website which aims to bring together runners of any and all abilities who prefer to take things slow. As a social running community the focus is more on camaraderie, support and making running accessible rather than performance. The idea was sparked in response to frequent posts on social-media sites such as Facebook from casual runners looking for people to join them in training either for social or safety reasons, or to help them be accountable to themselves and their programme. The goal of Calm Cadence is to apply a more structured event booking approach in order to help people find other runners to join them. Despite pervasive elitism in the field, running is for everyone regardless of pace or time and it is hoped that a community built around these principles will bring more people to the sport.
