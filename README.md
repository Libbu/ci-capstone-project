# Calm Cadence (Capstone Project for CI - Coleg Gwent Bootcamp)

![Calm Cadence](https://github.com/Libbu/ci-capstone-project/blob/main/media/amiresponsive.JPG)

Calm Cadence is a website which aims to bring together runners of any and all abilities who prefer to take things slow. As a social running community the focus is more on camaraderie, support and making running accessible rather than performance. The idea was sparked in response to frequent posts on social-media sites such as Facebook from casual runners looking for people to join them in training either for social or safety reasons, or to help them be accountable to themselves and their programme. The goal of Calm Cadence is to apply a more structured event booking approach in order to help people find other runners to join them. Despite pervasive elitism in the field, running is for everyone regardless of pace or time and it is hoped that a community built around these principles will bring more people to the sport.

# Purpose

This website has been built using the Django framework for backend and frontend functionality. 

This website provides all essential features to meet its stated goal, such as allowing users to register, create events, attend events, see records of events they have created/attended, as well as administrator specific access to approve posts, delete comments, and update text on the homepage.

Taking the lead of other sport-related apps such as Strava and Spond; users must be registered in order to access the events on the site.

This website was developed for the capstone project at the conclusion of the Code Institute Bootcamp through Coleg Gwent.

The live website can be accessed here.
